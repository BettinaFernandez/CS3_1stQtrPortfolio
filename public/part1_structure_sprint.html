  <h1>My Favorite Recipe: Beef Brocolli :D </h1>
  <p>I've tasted many recipes of beef brocolli from other restaurants, but I favor the way my dad cooks it the most. He always makes sure to balance its flavor, which led to me calling it as my favorite dish.</p>

      <li> 2 tbsp coconut oil </li>
      <li> 1 pc white onion, chopped </li>

      <li> 2 tbsp oyster sauce </li>
      <li> 200 g broccoli, cut into florets </li>
      <li> 1 tbsp cornstarch, dissolved in 1 to 2 tbsp water </li>
  </ul>>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
 <ol> 
      <li> Heat a pan over medium heat. Add canola oil and sauté onion and garlic until fragrant.</li>
      <li> Add beef and sear on both sides until browned. </li>
