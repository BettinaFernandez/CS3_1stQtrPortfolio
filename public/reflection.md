# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
1. If-else Statements - I find if-else statements very easy to use and understand so that's why I'm very familiar with them. They are based on decisions made by the coder that executes different blokcs of codes based on wether the statement is true or false.
2. For-Loops - For loops are the second most familiar to me, mostly because of coding out shapes. They repeat a single block of code for a specific number of times, and it repeats tasks more efficiently.
3. Functions - I used functions for my final CS project last year, and it helped my code become more organized and easier to debug. These are blocks of codes that executes when they are called.
4. Switch Statements - These are my favorite type of conditional statements. Switch statements are sort of an alternative for if-else statements, but are more cleaner to look at. They execute blocks of code based on the value of a variable or expression.
5. Data Types - Most easiest concept for me. They very much close to C++, so I mostly did not have a hard time getting introduced to JS basics. These define the type of variable they are holding, such as null, string, boolean, etc.

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed. 
1. Arrays - Although I'm very much familiar with arrays, I still have a hard time trying to use them. I understand operators like push or pop when using arrays, but I'm still trying to get familiar with how the syntax is supposed to be when storing or accessing data.
2. HTML Basics - I've been mostly studying on how to use JS than on how to use HTML. I'm in the process of learning how to input or output codes in HTML files, especially when it comes to functions and elements.
3. Functions - I mentioned in the previous question that I'm fond of functions, but I'm not particularly fond of HTML functions. The previous exercises that I did were

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
My plan of action is to search for videos or websites that can better help me understand the code I am working on. I will put my studies from trustworthy sources, such as school websites or videos from the same creators that my past two CS teachers provided me. Other than that, I would want to seek help more often immediately whenever I don't understand a topic or if I have a question on how to utilize certain operators. Most of all, I will start taking notes during class, because so far I've only depended on my auditory skills and only took small notes during class. I realized that I'm much more suited to be a visual learner so that's why I want to make sure that from now on I will take notes of everything that I find important during my lessons.

# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
> ### Effective:
1. The first activity that I found effective was the group activity of writing and tracing codes on paper on the topic of shapes. This somehow helped me by cooperating with my classmates and pointed out how we would code the prompt in our own perspective. We had many similarites when declaring and organizing the for loops, but we mostly differ when it came to outputting the symbols itself. There were a few times where my ideas did not work and neither did their's, but after some time and a few more discussing, we eventually concluded to one answer wherein the shape was properly outputted when traced and evaluated.
2. The second activity, or in this case activities, were the
